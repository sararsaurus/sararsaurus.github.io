      <li>Starting SomeTrails, the app I wish I had as a USFS volunteer! I've hardcoded all my data for now to get the first draft up and running, but I've designed everything to have room to grow as I do. For example, eventually the trail conditions data will be ethically scraped from other sources and the forecast and sunrise/sunset times will call back to external APIs. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Giving myself this room for future growth has necessarily made the app's structure more challenging than if I had simply assigned each trail a set of permanent conditions. I was able to successfully (and relatively painlessly!) figure out how to get these nested attributes to display in the frontend:</li>
      <img class="screenshot" src="images/Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 9.32.49 AM.png" alt="code">
      <br>
      <li>But, allowing a user to schedule a hike for the trail they were viewing (rather than requiring them to input the trail info separately) was NOT as painless. Turns out you need to combine functions - so, rather than having a totally separate <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">HikesNew</span>, I needed to add it to the relevant modal in every location.</li> <img class="screenshot" src="images/Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.09.48 PM.png" alt="code">

        <li>Started figuring out how to use info from a CSV file - a common format for a lot of data.

      <li>Made progress on the full-stack news app. (It's still pretty basic and it just uses a free news API... of questionable quality.) But I added users, sessions, and authentication to the Rails backend and corresponding authentication to the React frontend. The backend has POST routes for users and sessions and logs them in with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are then added to the axios default headers and retained in the browser's local storage.</li>
      <br>

      <li>I added rock paper scissors to my choose-your-own-adventure game, and now I need to think through whether it's just a nice detour or if there should be points that mean something if you win. I also need to think through my overall gameplay a bit if I want to keep this an educational game; it's definitely harder to write than a monster-slaying, cavern-escaping game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>THM's Advent of Cyber started off strong this week with an intro to hardware hacking! We used a logic analyzer to examine the signals traveling between devices, and we learned about protocols for transmitting data: USART (serial communication), SPI (which separates the clock from the data line and so has an extra wire compared to USART, but is faster and more reliable), and I2C (which was created to mitigate the drawbacks of both USART and SPI - over a thousand devices can be connected to the same two lines). Without protocols, we'd need an unfathomable number of wires to transmit the binary representation of each <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/" target="_blank">ASCII character</a>).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Then we had fun with IoT devices, which of course are uniquely vulnerable because they typically must be lightweight, without human-enabled authentication (like a manually typed password), and designed to all be interconnected. Security is often at best a secondary consideration. IoT devices typically rely on middleware to support their messaging protocol, such as MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, or DDS. (And then I had a little moment of panic where I realized I didn't fully understand what a port is...it's just a virtual point where network connections start and end, software-based and managed by a computer's OS.) And we intepreted some device source code to figure out its expected behavior so we could send a message and change its behavior - which required puzzling out some JSON hashes! </li>

      <li>HUGE NEWS! I was able to connect a backend API with a frontend that displays on a webpage. The primary trick was making sure that my backend renders <em>only</em> what I want to disply on my webpage.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Changing the terminal game I built last week from a demo helped me better understand how its unfamiliar code works. For example, the RNG generator uses Ruby's upto function to deploy different numbers of dice for different scenarios. So, if we have 2 dice, we'll run the loop twice, but if we have 3, we'll run it thrice: <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">1.upto(number_of_dice) do</span>. I did, however, manage to break the gameplay... &#128539; </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We did a lot during this week's THM Advent of Cyber challenges. We dove into malware's classic patterns, like establishing network connections, using registry keys, and downloading/creating files. We tackled the layers of defense necessary to secure file uploads and user inputs on a web app by learning about file extension validation, file size validation, file renaming, and malware scanning and by practicing (in PHP) wrapping GET requests in a function that converts the input to an integer and using a prepared statement for our search function to separate the syntax of our SQL sentence from our WHERE parameters for file content validation. </li>
      <br>
      <li>We also learned about the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10 list</a> - specifically IDOR vulnerabilities (where a user can manipulate poor access control to bypass authorization). And we used industry tools like Wireshark to conduct traffic and packet analysis, which is the process of extracting, assessing, and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares, commands and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from prerecorded traffic files). And we learned a few Sigma rules to analyze logs and detect threats.</li>
      <br>
      <li>And, of course, <a href="https://regexone.com/">regexes</a> returned! Regexes, combined with HTML's built-in features, give us pretty granular control over user input. For example, <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">input type="text" id="uname" name="uname" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+"</span> will filter for a case-insensitive alphanumeric string. </li>

  </li>

  <img class = "screenshot" src="images/Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 6.00.25 PM.png">

  <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>On Day 10 of THM's Advent of Cyber, I learned about Cetus, a browswer plugin that's designed to help find and alter the data your computer stores in its memory for some games. On Day 11, I practiced using an open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python called Volatility to analyze dumps of volatile memory - the memory that's in use when a computer is powered on, like your clipboard or unsaved files - to see what malware was doing at a particular point in time.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I've been working on a terminal to-do app, and to create my incomplete tasks array I learned about Ruby's .select method. Turns out using .select on an array always creates a new array (therefore rendering unncessary my first attempt with a blank array and a conditional statement). Select is great when you want to filter a list and return an array with the results: <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">@tasks.select { |task| !task.completed }</span>.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Day 8 of THM's Advent of Cyber tackled smart contracts... which are only as smart (and as secure) as their programmed logic. A common vulnerability is re-entrancy, which occurs when a malicious contract exploits flawed logic by using a fallback function to continue depleting a contract's total balance. This was my first encounter with Solidity, an OOP language created specifically for smart contracts on blockchain platforms.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I was trying to validate ISBNs and needed to make sure that the string contained only digits until the last character. And lo, my first regex (regexp?): <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">/\D/.match(isbn_string.chop)</span>.</li>
    <br>
    <li>And then! On Day 7 of THM's Advent of Cyber, we practiced examining a malicious attachment. Once we extracted the ASCII and Unicode-printable sequences, we looked for embedded strings that could lead to suspicious domains. But of course the attacker tried to obfuscate their code, so we used a regex to find and remove some repeated characters. I guess once you start looking, regex (regexes?) are everywhere. (To be fair, I did unknowingly encounter them earlier with <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">grep</span> -- which, turns out, stands for global/regular expression/print. Here's a nifty <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/index.html" target="_blank">link</a> about finding things using the command line.)</li>

      <li> I tackled my scraping project again, but I haven't figured out how to get the data I really want. I'm trying
        to collect the trails for the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area, where I patrol as a US Forest Service volunteer. A
        state website has the KMZ for all trails in CO, so I was able to convert that to a ZIP file and extract the KML
        file that I could then open in Google Earth. BUT I haven't yet figured out how to extract only the information I
        want.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I tried using <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">nokogiri</span>
        because my KML file is actually primarily composed of XML and HTML. I tested my code to print the doc to the
        terminal and for some reason it only pulled a small portion. It did, interestingly, include more DOM-like
        features
        than were visible in the KML file I was working with in in TextEdit.</li>

          target="_blank">Advent of Cyber</a>! We'll complete a task each day of the month and cover red teaming, cyber investigations, web exploitation, IoT hacking, and cyber defense &#127873; &#127876;. On Day 2, I learned how to

        a sense for the data in a log file, <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">wc -l</span> to
        get the number of lines in it, and <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">grep</span>, which finds and prints lines that match a pattern, to
        search.
        <br>
        <br>
      <li>Day 3 was all about OSINT techniques like google dorking, which is using advanced search terms to locate
        specific file
        types, versions, text, and more; checking the WHOIS
        information of a website; evaluating the robots.txt file; and searching GitHub repos.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I was trying to write code that could tell if a string was all uppercase AND devoid of letters,
        and
        I
        was surprised to see that a fully numeric string was interpreted as uppercase. I eventually settled with <span

      <li>I think I may have found that better way. But first, an apparently famous joke:
        <em>"Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have
          two problems."</em>

      <li>Tried to build a simple <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-ruby/" target="_blank">web
          scraper</a> in Ruby. Scraping is tricky: it requires the relevant gem
        installs, familiarity with the DOM, logic to search through selectors, and some way to export it - before even
        tackling a dynamic page. I was able to scrape bits off a Wikipedia page and export those to a CSV file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I internalized the value of testing code in the rails console. It was how I figured out what exactly we were
        trying to do in the whole MVC structure, and testing it earlier was a lot less cumbersome than finding errors
        later. We'd swiftly find out if our model associations weren't quite right, without having to suffer through
        making the controller attempt to generate a view.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Tackled a team project this week! Finding the right team rhythm is just as important as figuring out the code.
        We improved our ability to successfully implement Git branches and pulls and we found good resources that helped
        us with
        parts of the problem that were beyond our current skillset. In the future we'd spend more time conceptutalizing
        the project as a whole before diving in.</li>

      <li> Carefully creating sessions and tokens when building your app is key to preventing
        Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Input sanitization, particularly the removal of necessary coding
        characters and dangerous keywords, is important to defending against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li>

      <li>Best practices for PTT radio use: No Hollywood lingo! Listen first before transmitting,
        rehearse what you're going to say, depress the talk switch for 1-2 seconds before talking, and release the
        button when you're done.

        for

      <br>
      <li>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates applications into three main categories: the model, the view, and the controller. In this pattern, each component has its own specific responsibility. While implemented slightly differently in various frameworks, the general pattern is one of the most frequently used industry standards for creating scalable and extensible software. The Model is focused solely on the data and data-related logic of the application. This could be business data for the application or data that is being transacted between the View and Controller. The View is concerned only with the UI of the application and should not know what the business logic of the application is. The only logic the View should be concerned with is how to display data, based on what kind of data it was handed. The Controller acts as the go-between for the Model and the View. It handles any user interaction coming from the View, and determines any changes that may need to be made to the Model. It can also manipulate data from the Model to give to the View, for rendering a final output.</li>

        <p>Computers may be as close as we get to magic in the real world: we type incantations into a machine, and —
          if
          the incantations are right — the machine does our bidding. To perform such magic, computer witches and
          wizards
          rely not only on words, but also on wands, potions, and an ancient tome or two. Taken together, these tricks
          of the trade are known as software development: computer programming, plus tools like command lines, text
          editors, and version control.</p>
