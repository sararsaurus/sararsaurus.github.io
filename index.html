            <p>
              I wanted to tackle a project that would help me really understand React Hooks, so I decided to refactor
              some
              <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-react-introduction" target="_blank">
                outdated Codecademy code
              </a>
              that uses classes rather than functions and repetitive component lifecycle code like
              <code class="codespan">componentDidMount</code>
              and
              <code class="codespan">componentDidUpdate</code>
              . Hooks were introduced in 2018 as an addition to React 16.8 and offered an elegant way to add (or
              <em>hook</em>
              into) React features without writing a class. And
              <code class="codespan">useEffect</code>
              in particular eliminates the need for some repetitive code that instructs the browser what to render.
              <br />
              <br />
              I simplified the project to start. I'll eventually turn this into a random color generator, but for now
              I'm just going to create a button that changes its background color when clicked. I did something similar
              with the
              <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/animal_fun_facts" target="_blank">animal facts app</a>
              , but in that case I just manipulated the DOM directly via
              <code class="codespan">document.getElementById</code>
              . This time we're going to do it the right way by using state. The funny thing is that I've used all these
              concepts in more sophisticated ways before, particularly with
              <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/frontend-happy-trails" target="blank">SomeTrails</a>
              , but it takes doing and unpacking several times to really internalize it.

            I'm going to start translating BBC Arabic headlines to recover some of the vocabulary I used to have.
            (Headlines are a lot more manageable than even a couple sentences, so it's a good place to start. Plus,
            Google makes it easy to check my work.)

            Added some new functionality to my animal facts app. I learned how to make multiple things happen with one

            to access specific HTML elements, and then I used a couple different properties to do different things, like
            replace the content of HTML elements (
            <code class="codespan">innerHTML</code>
            ) or change the value of an HTML attribute (

            Playing with this prompted me look into how React
            <em>should</em>
            handle interactivity, which inexorably led to

              React's state management
            </a>
            (because, of course, state is how a React component 'remembers' things. And, as I always need to remind
            myself, hooks are just special functions that allow components to use React features like state). But...I'm
            not even using state with this app! &#128576;

            Stafa and Rruga e Saraçeve in Tirana, Albania. Honing in on the small street sign got me to Tirana. Then I
            looked for intersections that would be closed - turns out it's a one-way street - and then for a bike shop.
            And voila!

            I started building out a Codecademy project so that it could live
            <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/animal_fun_facts" target="_blank">free</a>
            in the wild. I always like to do this with demos because I learn a lot more if I figure out how to make it
            actually work on my own computer. Plus, it's fun! In this case, I created all the CSS (and found the images
            - sorry), adapted the legacy React 17 stuff (no more
            <code class="codespan">ReactDOM.render()</code>
            ), and figured out how to translate it all into an app that I could locally host.
            <br />
            <br />
            The code itself is also pretty cool. It simply uses another React file to generate the data (kind of a
            backend shortcut), and then iterates through that data. And I learned how to generate text by clicking on an
            image!
            <br />
            <br />
            Next step is to add some new functionality, like making an image change color, disappear, or resize when
            clicked.

            Completed my AIARE 1! I really loved the intersection of science (snow, weather, fracture mechanics),
            heuristics, ethics, and team dynamics. When it comes to avalanche safety, how our group works together is
            critical: we travel and decide together, we genuinely listen to every voice, we constantly challenge
            assumptions, and everyone gets a veto. As

                  enjoy the backcountry, and how we live on to cherish the memories we create together in the mountains.

            Got some simple query parameters working! A user can now type a search term into the browser to change the
            call that my Rails backend is making to a free third-party API.

            And since I was on a roll, I added to my amigurumi store the capability for a user to filter the category of
            available products. When I get to my frontend, I'll need to figure out how to create a button or form to
            intake the query parameters.

            Started figuring out how to use info from a CSV file - a common format for a lot of data. Fortunately, Ruby
            is ready for this and all we need to do is use that built-in functionality with a loop instructing Rails how
            to pull the data into the database (credit to

            So I picked back up with building open-source research skills. Interestingly, as I was practicing filtering
            search results (e.g., site: bbc.co.uk gchq news filetype:pdf or intitle:index.of), Google hit me with a

            Made progress on the full-stack news app. I added users, sessions, and authentication to the Rails backend
            and corresponding authentication to the React frontend. The backend has POST routes for users and sessions
            and logs them in with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are then added to the axios default headers and retained
            in the browser's local storage.

            <br />
            I also imported bootstrap and zhuzed it up a bit! I used modals for the signup and login features because
            modal windows offer better speed than creating new pages.

            Separately, I added rock paper scissors to my choose-your-own-adventure game, and now I need to think
            through whether it's just a nice detour or if there should be points that mean something if you win. I also
            need to think through my overall gameplay a bit if I want to keep this an educational game; it's definitely
            harder to write than a monster-slaying, cavern-escaping game.

            <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>

            THM's Advent of Cyber started off strong this week with an intro to hardware hacking! We used a logic
            analyzer to examine the signals traveling between devices, and we learned about protocols for transmitting
            data: USART (serial communication), SPI (which separates the clock from the data line and so has an extra
            wire compared to USART, but is faster and more reliable), and I2C (which was created to mitigate the
            drawbacks of both USART and SPI - over a thousand devices can be connected to the same two lines). Without
            protocols, we'd need an unfathomable number of wires to transmit the binary representation of each
            <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/" target="_blank">ASCII character</a>
            ).
            <br />
            <br />
            Then we had fun with IoT devices, which of course are uniquely vulnerable because they typically must be
            lightweight, without human-enabled authentication (like a manually typed password), and designed to all be
            interconnected. Security is often at best a secondary consideration. IoT devices typically rely on
            middleware to support their messaging protocol, such as MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, or DDS. (And then I had a little
            moment of panic where I realized I didn't fully understand what a port is...it's just a virtual point where
            network connections start and end, software-based and managed by a computer's OS.) And we interpreted some
            device source code to figure out its expected behavior so we could send a message and change its behavior -
            which required puzzling out some JSON hashes!

            I connected a backend API with a frontend that displays on a webpage! The primary trick was making sure that
            my backend renders
            <em>only</em>
            what I want to display on my webpage.
            <br />
            <br />
            Changing the terminal game I built last week from a demo helped me better understand how its unfamiliar code
            works. For example, the RNG generator uses Ruby's upto function to deploy different numbers of dice for
            different scenarios. So, if we have 2 dice, we'll run the loop twice, but if we have 3, we'll run it thrice:
            <code class="codespan">1.upto(number_of_dice) do</code>
            . I did, however, manage to break the gameplay... &#128539;
            <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>
            We did a lot during this week's THM Advent of Cyber challenges. We dove into malware's classic patterns,
            like establishing network connections, using registry keys, and downloading/creating files. We tackled the
            layers of defense necessary to secure file uploads and user inputs on a web app by learning about file
            extension validation, file size validation, file renaming, and malware scanning and by practicing (in PHP)
            wrapping GET requests in a function that converts the input to an integer and using a prepared statement for
            our search function to separate the syntax of our SQL sentence from our WHERE parameters for file content
            validation.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also learned about the
            <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10 list</a>
            - specifically IDOR vulnerabilities (where a user can manipulate poor access control to bypass
            authorization). And we used industry tools like Wireshark to conduct traffic and packet analysis, which is
            the process of extracting, assessing, and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares, commands
            and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from prerecorded traffic files). And we
            learned a few Sigma rules to analyze logs and detect threats.
            <br />
            <br />
            And, of course,
            <a href="https://regexone.com/">regexes</a>
            returned! Regexes, combined with HTML's built-in features, give us pretty granular control over user input.
            For example,
            <code class="codespan">input type="text" id="uname" name="uname" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+"</code>
            will filter for a case-insensitive alphanumeric string.

            <a href="https://youtu.be/wMJ6lxgT-mE" target="_blank">great demo</a>
            to create a simple terminal-based adventure game. It was an excellent introduction to thinking through
            gameplay and I'm excited to build on it next week.

            <br />

            <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>

            On Day 10 of THM's Advent of Cyber, I learned about Cetus, a browser plugin that's designed to help find and
            alter the data your computer stores in its memory for some games. On Day 11, I practiced using an
            open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python called Volatility to analyze dumps of volatile memory
            - the memory that's in use when a computer is powered on, like your clipboard or unsaved files - to see what
            malware was doing at a particular point in time.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've been working on a terminal to-do app, and to create my incomplete tasks array I learned about Ruby's
            .select method. Turns out using .select on an array always creates a new array (therefore rendering
            unnecessary my first attempt with a blank array and a conditional statement). Select is great when you want
            to filter a list and return an array with the results:
            <code class="codespan">@tasks.select { |task| !task.completed }</code>
            .
            <br />
            <br />
            Day 8 of THM's Advent of Cyber tackled smart contracts... which are only as smart (and as secure) as their
            programmed logic. A common vulnerability is re-entrancy, which occurs when a malicious contract exploits
            flawed logic by using a fallback function to continue depleting a contract's total balance. This was my
            first encounter with Solidity, an OOP language created specifically for smart contracts on blockchain
            platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
            I was trying to validate ISBNs and needed to make sure that the string contained only digits until the last
            character. And lo, my first regex (regexp?):
            <code class="codespan">/\D/.match(isbn_string.chop)</code>
            .
            <br />
            <br />
            And then! On Day 7 of THM's Advent of Cyber, we practiced examining a malicious attachment. Once we
            extracted the ASCII and Unicode-printable sequences, we looked for embedded strings that could lead to
            suspicious domains. But of course the attacker tried to obfuscate their code, so we used a regex to find and
            remove some repeated characters. I guess once you start looking, regex (regexes?) are everywhere. (To be
            fair, I did unknowingly encounter them earlier with
            <code class="codespan">grep</code>
            -- which, turns out, stands for global/regular expression/print. Here's a nifty
            <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/index.html" target="_blank">link</a>
            about finding things using the command line.)

            Made a simple terminal app! It uses a number of tty gems for beautification and a few different free APIs to
            generate the data.

            I tackled my scraping project again, but I haven't figured out how to get the data I really want. I'm trying
            to collect the trails for the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area, where I patrol as a US Forest Service volunteer.
            A state website has the KMZ for all trails in CO, so I was able to convert that to a ZIP file and extract
            the KML file that I could then open in Google Earth. BUT I haven't yet figured out how to extract only the
            information I want.
            <br />
            <br />
            I tried using
            <code class="codespan">nokogiri</code>
            because my KML file is actually primarily composed of XML and HTML. I tested my code to print the doc to the
            terminal and for some reason it only pulled a small portion. It did, interestingly, include more DOM-like
            features than were visible in the KML file I was working with in in TextEdit.

            ! We'll complete a task each day of the month and cover red teaming, cyber investigations, web exploitation,
            IoT hacking, and cyber defense &#127873; &#127876;. On Day 2, I learned how to use
            <code class="codespan">nano</code>
            to get a sense for the data in a log file,
            <code class="codespan">wc -l</code>
            to get the number of lines in it, and
            <code class="codespan">grep</code>
            , which finds and prints lines that match a pattern, to search.
            <br />
            <br />
            Day 3 was all about OSINT techniques like google dorking, which is using advanced search terms to locate
            specific file types, versions, text, and more; checking the WHOIS information of a website; evaluating the
            robots.txt file; and searching GitHub repos.
            <br />
            <br />
            I was trying to write code that could tell if a string was all uppercase AND devoid of letters, and I was
            surprised to see that a fully numeric string was interpreted as uppercase. I eventually settled with
            <code class="codespan">
              elsif sentence == sentence.upcase && sentence.include?("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
            </code>
            but there's gotta be a better way.
            <br />
            <br />
            I think I may have found that better way. But first, an apparently famous joke:
            <em>
              "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have
              two problems."

            Carefully creating sessions and tokens when building your app is key to preventing Cross-Site Request
            Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Input sanitization, particularly the removal of necessary coding characters and
            dangerous keywords, is important to defending against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

                <p>
                  Computers may be as close as we get to magic in the real world: we type incantations into a machine,
                  and — if the incantations are right — the machine does our bidding. To perform such magic, computer
                  witches and wizards rely not only on words, but also on wands, potions, and an ancient tome or two.
                  Taken together, these tricks of the trade are known as software development: computer programming,
                  plus tools like command lines, text editors, and version control.
