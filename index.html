      <li>Made a cute little terminal app! It uses a number of tty gems for &#10024;beautification&#10024; and a few
        different free APIs
        to generate the data.

      <li>Tried to build a simple <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-ruby/" target="_blank">web
          scraper</a> in Ruby. Scraping is kind of tricky: it requires the relevant gem
        installs, familiarity with the DOM, logic to search through selectors, and some way to export it - before even
        tackling a dynamic page. I was able to scrape bits off a Wikipedia page and export those to a CSV file. </li>

    <ul>
      <li>I internalized the value of testing code in the rails console! It was how I figured out what exactly we were
        trying to do in the whole MVC structure, and testing it earlier was a lot less cumbersome than finding errors
        later. We'd swiftly find out if our model associations weren't quite right, without having to suffer through
        making the controller attempt to generate a view.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Tackled a team project this week! Finding the right team rhythm is just as important as figuring out the code.
        We improved our ability to successfully implement Git branches and pulls and we found good resources that helped
        us with
        parts of the problem that were beyond our current skillset. In the future we'd spend more time conceptutalizing
        the project as a whole before diving in.</li>

      <li> Carefully creating sessions and tokens when building your app is key to preventing
        Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Input sanitization, particularly the removal of necessary coding
        characters and dangerous keywords, is important to defending against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Getting at the key of a hash is tricky, but Ruby's <a href="https://www.rubyguides.com/ruby-tutorial/loops/"
          target="_blank">each method</a> helpfully offers an easy way to access it in a loop!</li>

              items = { "chair" => 100, "book" => 14 }

              items.each do |name, price|
              hash[name] = price
              end

      <li>Best practices for PTT radio use: No Hollywood lingo! Listen first before transmitting,
        rehearse what you're going to say, depress the talk switch for 1-2 seconds before talking, and release the
        button when you're done.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Found a news API! I bet that's what most "good news" apps are using. I also signed up to be a beta tester
        for
        a new tech news aggregator and I'll be curious to see whether it uses a similar API.</li>

        <p>Computers may be as close as we get to magic in the real world: we type incantations into a machine, and —
          if
          the incantations are right — the machine does our bidding. To perform such magic, computer witches and
          wizards
          rely not only on words, but also on wands, potions, and an ancient tome or two. Taken together, these tricks
          of the trade are known as software development: computer programming, plus tools like command lines, text
          editors, and version control.</p>
