                    Pyramid of Pain
                  </a>
                  is a diagram created in 2013 that "shows the relationship between the types of indicators you might
                  use to detect an adversary's activities and how much pain it will cause them when you are able to deny
                  those indicators to them."

                  A
                  <strong>hash value</strong>
                  is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data and is the result of a hashing
                  algorithm, such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2. Hash values form the base of the pyramid, meaning that
                  finding hash values is an indicator of malicious activity and that disrupting an adversary's hash
                  values will inflict trivial pain to them. These hashes can reflect a malware sample or a malicious
                  file and can be used as a way to uniquely identify and reference a malicious artifact, and various
                  online tools can be used look up a hash, like VirusTotal and Metadefender Cloud-OPSWAT. But, it's so
                  easy for an adversary to change a hash value, and there are so many of them around, that in many cases
                  it may not even be worth tracking them.

                  <br />
                  <strong>IP addresses</strong>
                  are used to identify any device (a desktop computer, a server, a CCTV camera, etc) connected to a
                  network. Knowing an adversary's IP address is valuable, and defenders can block, drop, or deny
                  particular inbound requests, but it's unfortunately again pretty trivial for an adversary to simply
                  switch to a new IP address or use

                  server challenging.
                  <!-- Step 1: Identify a questionable IP address alerted in a security monitoring tool.
                  <br />
                  Step 2: Look up the IP address. There are many open-source databases out there like AbuseIPDB, Cisco
                  Talos Intelligence, where you can perform a reputation and location check for the IP address. You can
                  also make the Internet safer by reporting the malicious IPs, for example, on AbuseIPDB. -->

                <p>
                  We practiced the very first teensy step a pentester would take when reviewing an application. Using
                  only the in-built browser tools, we hunted for sensitive information left in the frontend code, looked
                  for known bugs about the framework version used, poked around in directories we could access, and
                  inspected the JavaScript and GET/POST requests. (A breeze for anyone with programming experience!)

                  Finished up the React random color generator app (check out the
                  <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/random-color-picker">repo</a>
                  here)! My original idea was to refactor a lot of legacy Codecademy code, but I decided it made more
                  sense to just build a new version myself using current best practices. And turns out my version, which
                  uses React Hooks, only needs about half the lines of code that the Codecademy version did. So it was a
                  perfect way to really see the utility of Hooks in practice! It also helped me understand that State
                  can be a number of things (a boolean, a string, an operator) and that State can do more than a single
                  thing at once - in this case, it changes both the background color and the visibility of some text.

                  It's also time to dip my toes back into algorithms. Not only is it appropriate to group them with my

                  While Europe was struggling through centuries marked by varying degrees of murk (I love that some
                  scholars hate calling the post-Roman era the "Dark Ages"), the Muslim world was enjoying a golden age
                  of science, culture, and economics. One of the resident scholars in Baghdad's House of Wisdom,
                  Muhammad Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, wrote a treatise on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in the 9th
                  century, and the word

                  System Configuration is the place to start for many helpful advanced tools. For example, System
                  Configuration > Computer Management > Event Viewer will display a record of the computer's activity
                  and is helpful for diagnosing problems and investigating actions executed on the system. And of course

                <h4 id="cybersecurity">MITRE ATT&CK</h4>
                <p>
                  ATT&CK is a free, open, and globally accessible knowledge base of observed adversary behaviors. ATT&CK
                  focuses on the TTPs (the tactics, techniques/sub-techniques, and procedures) executed by adversaries.
                  It was developed to document and understand adversary behaviors, it is built from publicly reported
                  cyber activity, and it connects TTPs to the threat actors and malware/tools that perform them. Those
                  relationships are captured in the ATT&CK matrices. ATT&CK creates a common language for security
                  practitioners and it can help us measure defenses against real adversary behaviors. ATT&CK Navigator
                  allows us to annotate these matrices to visualize, export, and share anything we're trying to capture
                  and present.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  ATT&CK considers tactics to be the goals an adversary has during an attack (adversary objectives / the
                  "why"); it treats tactics as objects and has assigned each a unique ID. These tactics are the column
                  headers in the enterprise matrix.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  ATT&CK defines techniques as the means by which adversaries achieve their goals (adversary behaviors /
                  the "how"). Sub-techniques are simply more specific; they always have a single parent and are often
                  specific to a single platform. They were created to capture innovations and changes of behaviors and
                  have a wealth of metadata like mitigations and detection. Technique IDs also have their own unique
                  identifiers and sub-technique IDs are extensions of their parent technique.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  ATT&CK defines mitigations as configurations, tools, or processes that can prevent an adversary
                  behavior from working. And of course, mitigations also have their own unique IDs and they're mapped to
                  specific techniques.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  ATT&CK data sources tell us what to collect (via sensors and logs, for example). ATT&CK detections
                  provide high-level strategies to identify a technique used by an adversary, essentially, a guide to
                  interpreting the collected data. ATT&CK groups are "clusters" of intrusion activity and software is,
                  well, what it sounds like: the tools/malware used by threat actors.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  ATT&CK allows us to map adversaries to behaviors via techniques and sub-techniques and references the
                  publicly available cyber threat intelligence about these behaviors.

                <h4 id="programming" id="cybersecurity">HTML & JavaScript Injection</h4>

                <p>
                  Adding a search bar to my blog prompted me think about adding in some security to prevent malicious
                  use. My original search bar didn't allow a user to write HTML to the page, so something like this
                  wouldn't actually work:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-03-10 at 1.44.31 PM.png" alt="screenshot" />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  But of course it's a best practice to sanitize any and all user input to prevent HTML or JavaScript
                  injections to redirect browsers, steal information, or conduct Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. I
                  thought that this might be another classic case of regex to the rescue, but turns out there are some
                  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">very salty opinions</a>
                  against it. So I used
                  <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a>
                  instead:
                  <br />

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  To work, DOMPurify needs to write HTML into the DOM element, so I had to add an
                  <code class="codespan">.innerHTML</code>
                  method that ties back to a placeholder
                  <code class="codespan">div</code>
                  in the HTML.

                  Why you should read this out loud
                </a>
                | "A growing body of research suggests that we may be missing out by reading only with the voices inside
                our minds. The ancient art of reading aloud has a number of benefits for adults, from helping improve

                <h4 id="networking">Network Fundamentals</h4>
                <p>
                  A network is just interconnected devices. The end! It's fascinating that everything we do, every day,
                  relies on that not-so-simple statement. And for some reason, the typical liberal arts education
                  ignores the centrality of networks, not only to the human experience, but to international relations
                  (IR) and governance. This is for another day, but I think we're missing out on some very neat
                  interdisciplinary connections, like the fact that today the internet operates largely without massive
                  international government support or intervention.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I imagine liberal arts prefers to keep networking in a safe silo because it's complicated and yet
                  still concrete; we're not at liberty to create models and argue about how it actually works (looking
                  at you, economics).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Anyway, every device that can be connected to a network - a phone, a computer, a wireless speaker -
                  has a MAC (Media Access Control) address and, once connected, an IP address. A MAC address is unique
                  to each device and IP addresses can change from device to device, although they cannot be active
                  simultaneously more than once within the same network. The protocols - a set of standards (not
                  developed or maintained by any government-level entity, IR!) - IP addresses follow are the backbone of
                  networking and enable devices to communicate.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Networks can be different sizes and span different geographical breadths. LAN is just a local area
                  network, for example. But then it starts to get confusing (and this is probably where IR jumps
                  overboard). There are a couple different models to describe
                  <em>how</em>
                  a network works and then even within a single type of network there are different topologies. Let's
                  start with the models, which break networking into different layers to categorize the different,
                  complicated functions that are responsible for specific tasks. Most humans are really only familiar
                  with
                  <em>part</em>
                  of one layer, the application layer (which is either one of seven layers in the OSI model, which is a
                  conceptual, neutral model, or one of four in the TCP/IP model, which specifically refers to how the
                  current Internet works): we use GUIs to send requests and receive data. I don't even know if that
                  counts as the tip of the iceberg; maybe it's just the initial snowfall on a glacier hundreds of years
                  before a chunk of ice calves into the sea.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Ok, so still within that application layer, we rely on network protocols to get the data transferring.
                  The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol converts domains to IP addresses, IMAP/POP/SMTP handle email,
                  and the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) handles our web requests to servers (and make our
                  applications' basic CRUD actions work). Opening the network tab in developer tools shows how many HTTP
                  requests are required to load a single specific website:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <img class="screenshot" src="images/Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 1.05.59 PM.png" alt="screenshot" />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Secure Shell (SSH) protocol enables access to a remote terminal or virtual machine over a secure
                  connection, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) does just that, and Server Message Block (SMB) protocol
                  allows users to interact with a remote system like a file share or printers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  And then super important protocols like TCP and UDP live in the TCP/IP model's transport layer - and
                  we haven't even talked about the other layers!

                  which grabs the relevant HTML (in this case, the HTML with an id of "searchbar"). This time, we'll

                  to loop over the relevant content to see if the user's input matches anything.

                  reverse image search easily pulled the text in the picture and identified the Flinders Street Railway
                  Station in Melbourne. Plugging the coordinates into Google Earth Pro and accessing the street view
                  feature provided a more accurate perspective of the tall structures in view, and a simple Google
                  search yielded the heights for the buildings in question (although, of course, the first Google hit
                  was for something else &#128539;).

                  which was created by one of the (now-former) OSINT Curious members. Good imagery intelligence, or
                  IMINT, analysis starts with methodically decomposing the image and focusing on the context,
                  foreground, and background, noting any particular things like signs or landmarks along the way. The
                  hardest part of this particular challenge was identifying the photographer of a particular image; the
                  image didn't show up in my reverse image searches, so I looked at an embedded map in the official city
                  tourism page and found it there. We also experimented with
                  <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/about.html">FFmpeg</a>
                  , a tool to parse and process videos, although for this (relatively easy) exercise I found Google
                  Earth Pro to be equally useful.

                <p>
                  I wanted brush up on my Linux because it's been a few weeks since I followed
                  <a href="https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html">Michael Bazzell's</a>
                  instructions to create Linux virtual machines and install a bunch of OSINT tools.

                  Linux is simply another operating system, like your Mac or Windows OS, except that it's not subject to
                  the same restrictive licensing. Linux's open-source nature makes it free and customizable for specific
                  purposes, such as cybersecurity. Linux is also present in our daily lives - it serves as the OS for
                  many IoT devices.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For today's project I practiced using SSH (secure shell) connections to hook up to the command line of
                  a remote Linux machine and I revisited some commands that I don't use on a daily basis in my other
                  programming endeavors:

                <h4 class="programming">React</h4>
                <p>
                  I wanted to tackle a project that would help me really understand React Hooks and what they were
                  designed to do, so I decided to refactor some
                  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-react-introduction" target="_blank">
                    old Codecademy code
                  </a>
                  that uses classes rather than functions and repetitive component lifecycle code like
                  <code class="codespan">componentDidMount</code>
                  and
                  <code class="codespan">componentDidUpdate.</code>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Or, in English, today's best practices use different JavaScript syntax to create the code that serves
                  as the fundamental building block for something that performs a
                  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions" target="_blank">
                    task.
                  </a>
                  And "component lifecycle code" is essentially how React gets your code onto the webpage, and the
                  syntax for doing that has also changed.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I simplified the project to start. I'll eventually turn this into a random color generator, but for
                  now I'm just going to create a button that changes its background color when clicked. I did something
                  similar with the
                  <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/animal_fun_facts" target="_blank">animal facts app,</a>
                  but in that case I just manipulated the DOM directly via
                  <code class="codespan">document.getElementById.</code>
                  This time we're going to do it the right way by using state. The funny thing is that I've used all
                  these concepts in more sophisticated ways before, particularly with
                  <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/frontend-happy-trails" target="blank">SomeTrails,</a>
                  but it takes doing and unpacking several times to really internalize it.

                Added some new functionality to my animal facts app. I learned how to make multiple things happen with
                one
                <code class="codespan">onClick</code>
                and took a deep dive into
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp" target="_blank">
                  JavaScript's capabilities to manipulate the HTML DOM.
                </a>
                <br />
                <br />
                So, when a webpage is loaded, the browser (praise be for browsers!) creates a Document Object Model, or
                DOM, of the page. That object model allows JavaScript to change HTML elements and create &#9889; dynamic
                &#9889; HTML. There are two key terms to know for this: methods and properties. Methods are actions you
                can perform on HTML elements, and properties are the values of HTML elements that you can set or change.
                And, in a nutshell, that's what I did for this project!
                <br />
                <br />
                Specifically, I used the method
                <code class="codespan">getElementById</code>
                to access specific HTML elements, and then I used a couple different properties to do different things,
                like replace the content of HTML elements (
                <code class="codespan">innerHTML</code>
                ) or change the value of an HTML attribute (
                <code class="codespan">.attribute</code>
                ).
                <br />
                <br />
                <img class="screenshot" src="images/2023-02-23 11.30.05.gif" alt="gif demo" />

                handle interactivity, which inexorably led to

                  React's state management
                </a>
                (because, of course, state is how a React component 'remembers' things. And, as I always need to remind
                myself, hooks are just special functions that allow components to use React features like state).
                But...I'm not even using state with this app! &#128576;

                The photo, which didn't have any available EXIF data, was taken on the at the intersection of Rruga
                Qemal Stafa and Rruga e Saraçeve in Tirana, Albania. Homing in on the small street sign got me to
                Tirana. Then I looked for intersections that would be closed - turns out it's a one-way street - and
                then for a bike shop. And voila!

                I started building out a Codecademy project so that it could live
                <a href="https://github.com/sararsaurus/animal_fun_facts" target="_blank">free</a>
                in the wild. I always like to do this with demos because I learn a lot more if I figure out how to make
                it actually work on my own computer. Plus, it's fun! In this case, I created all the CSS (and found the
                images - regrettably), adapted the legacy React 17 stuff (no more
                <code class="codespan">ReactDOM.render()</code>
                ), and figured out how to translate it all into an app that I could locally host.
                <br />
                <br />
                The code itself is also pretty cool. It simply uses another React file to generate the data (kind of a
                backend shortcut), and then iterates through that data. Next step is to add some new functionality, like
                making an image change color, disappear, or resize when clicked.

                is what we do to enable components to share data and always update together. I know that somehow this is

                through whether it's just a nice detour or if there should be points that mean something if you win. I
                also need to think through my overall gameplay a bit if I want to keep this an educational game; it's
                definitely harder to write than a monster-slaying, cavern-escaping game.

                <h4 id="learnings">Learnings</h4>

                THM's Advent of Cyber started off strong this week with an intro to hardware hacking! We used a logic
                analyzer to examine the signals traveling between devices, and we learned about protocols for
                transmitting data: USART (serial communication), SPI (which separates the clock from the data line and
                so has an extra wire compared to USART, but is faster and more reliable), and I2C (which was created to
                mitigate the drawbacks of both USART and SPI - over a thousand devices can be connected to the same two
                lines). Without protocols, we'd need an unfathomable number of wires to transmit the binary
                representation of each
                <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/" target="_blank">ASCII character.</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                Then we had fun with IoT devices, which of course are uniquely vulnerable because they typically must be
                lightweight, without human-enabled authentication (like a manually typed password), and designed to all
                be interconnected. Security is often at best a secondary consideration. IoT devices typically rely on
                middleware to support their messaging protocol, such as MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, or DDS. (And then I had a
                little moment of panic where I realized I didn't fully understand what a port is...it's just a virtual
                point where network connections start and end, software-based and managed by a computer's OS.) And we
                interpreted some device source code to figure out its expected behavior so we could send a message and
                change its behavior - which required puzzling out some JSON hashes!

                I connected a backend API with a frontend that displays on a webpage! The primary trick was making sure
                that my backend renders
                <em>only</em>
                what I want to display on my webpage.
                <br />
                <br />
                Changing the terminal game I built last week from a demo helped me better understand how its unfamiliar
                code works. For example, the RNG generator uses Ruby's upto function to deploy different numbers of dice
                for different scenarios. So, if we have 2 dice, we'll run the loop twice, but if we have 3, we'll run it
                thrice:
                <code class="codespan">1.upto(number_of_dice) do</code>
                . I did, however, manage to break the gameplay... &#128539;
                <p>And! Finally finished this little dragon! Time to send him off to an excited little baby!</p>

                <h4 id="learnings">Learnings</h4>
                We did a lot during this week's THM Advent of Cyber challenges. We dove into malware's classic patterns,
                like establishing network connections, using registry keys, and downloading/creating files. We tackled
                the layers of defense necessary to secure file uploads and user inputs on a web app by learning about
                file extension validation, file size validation, file renaming, and malware scanning and by practicing
                (in PHP) wrapping GET requests in a function that converts the input to an integer and using a prepared
                statement for our search function to separate the syntax of our SQL sentence from our WHERE parameters
                for file content validation.
                <br />
                <br />
                We also learned about the
                <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10 list</a>
                - specifically IDOR vulnerabilities (where a user can manipulate poor access control to bypass
                authorization). And we used industry tools like Wireshark to conduct traffic and packet analysis, which
                is the process of extracting, assessing, and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares,
                commands and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from prerecorded traffic
                files). And we learned a few Sigma rules to analyze logs and detect threats.
                <br />
                <br />
                And, of course,
                <a href="https://regexone.com/">regexes</a>
                returned! Regexes, combined with HTML's built-in features, give us pretty granular control over user
                input. For example,
                <code class="codespan">input type="text" id="uname" name="uname" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+"</code>
                will filter for a case-insensitive alphanumeric string.

                I followed a
                <a href="https://youtu.be/wMJ6lxgT-mE" target="_blank">great demo</a>
                to create a simple terminal-based adventure game. It was an excellent introduction to thinking through
                gameplay and I'm excited to build on it next week.

                <br />
                <img class="small-screenshot" src="images/Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 6.00.25 PM.png" />

                <h4 id="learnings">Learnings</h4>

                On Day 10 of THM's Advent of Cyber, I learned about Cetus, a browser plugin that's designed to help find
                and alter the data your computer stores in its memory for some games. On Day 11, I practiced using an
                open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python called Volatility to analyze dumps of volatile
                memory - the memory that's in use when a computer is powered on, like your clipboard or unsaved files -
                to see what malware was doing at a particular point in time.
                <br />
                <br />
                I've been working on a terminal to-do app, and to create my incomplete tasks array I learned about
                Ruby's .select method. Turns out using .select on an array always creates a new array (therefore
                rendering unnecessary my first attempt with a blank array and a conditional statement). Select is great
                when you want to filter a list and return an array with the results:
                <code class="codespan">@tasks.select { |task| !task.completed }</code>
                .
                <br />
                <br />
                Day 8 of THM's Advent of Cyber tackled smart contracts... which are only as smart (and as secure) as
                their programmed logic. A common vulnerability is re-entrancy, which occurs when a malicious contract
                exploits flawed logic by using a fallback function to continue depleting a contract's total balance.
                This was my first encounter with Solidity, an OOP language created specifically for smart contracts on
                blockchain platforms.
                <br />
                <br />
                I was trying to validate ISBNs and needed to make sure that the string contained only digits until the
                last character. And lo, my first regex (regexp?):
                <code class="codespan">/\D/.match(isbn_string.chop)</code>
                .
                <br />
                <br />
                And then! On Day 7 of THM's Advent of Cyber, we practiced examining a malicious attachment. Once we
                extracted the ASCII and Unicode-printable sequences, we looked for embedded strings that could lead to
                suspicious domains. But of course the attacker tried to obfuscate their code, so we used a regex to find
                and remove some repeated characters. I guess once you start looking, regex (regexes?) are everywhere.
                (To be fair, I did unknowingly encounter them earlier with
                <code class="codespan">grep</code>
                -- which, turns out, stands for global/regular expression/print. Here's a nifty
                <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/index.html" target="_blank">link</a>
                about finding things using the command line.)

                Made a simple terminal app! It uses a number of tty gems for beautification and a few different free

                I tackled my scraping project again, but I haven't figured out how to get the data I really want. I'm
                trying to collect the trails for the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area, where I patrol as a US Forest Service
                volunteer. A state website has the KMZ for all trails in CO, so I was able to convert that to a ZIP file
                and extract the KML file that I could then open in Google Earth. BUT I haven't yet figured out how to
                extract only the information I want.
                <br />
                <br />
                I tried using
                <code class="codespan">nokogiri</code>
                because my KML file is actually primarily composed of XML and HTML. I tested my code to print the doc to
                the terminal and for some reason it only pulled a small portion. It did, interestingly, include more
                DOM-like features than were visible in the KML file I was working with in in TextEdit.

                exploitation, IoT hacking, and cyber defense &#127873; &#127876;. On Day 2, I learned how to use
                <code class="codespan">nano</code>
                to get a sense for the data in a log file,
                <code class="codespan">wc -l</code>
                to get the number of lines in it, and
                <code class="codespan">grep</code>
                , which finds and prints lines that match a pattern, to search.
                <br />
                <br />
                Day 3 was all about OSINT techniques like google dorking, which is using advanced search terms to locate
                specific file types, versions, text, and more; checking the WHOIS information of a website; evaluating
                the robots.txt file; and searching GitHub repos.
                <br />
                <br />
                I was trying to write code that could tell if a string was all uppercase AND devoid of letters, and I
                was surprised to see that a fully numeric string was interpreted as uppercase. I eventually settled with
                <code class="codespan">
                  elsif sentence == sentence.upcase && sentence.include?("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
                </code>
                but there's gotta be a better way.
                <br />
                <br />
                I think I may have found that better way. But first, an apparently famous joke:
                <em>
                  "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they

                Carefully creating sessions and tokens when building your app is key to preventing Cross-Site Request
                Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Input sanitization, particularly the removal of necessary coding characters and
                dangerous keywords, is important to defending against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

                Getting at the key of a hash is tricky, but Ruby's
                <a href="https://www.rubyguides.com/ruby-tutorial/loops/" target="_blank">each method</a>
                helpfully offers an easy way to access it in a loop!

                      Computers may be as close as we get to magic in the real world: we type incantations into a
                      machine, and — if the incantations are right — the machine does our bidding. To perform such
                      magic, computer witches and wizards rely not only on words, but also on wands, potions, and an
                      ancient tome or two. Taken together, these tricks of the trade are known as software development:
                      computer programming, plus tools like command lines, text editors, and version control.
