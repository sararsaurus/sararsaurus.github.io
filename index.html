    <li>I was trying to validate ISBNs and needed to make sure that the string contained only digits until the last character. And lo, my first regex (regexp?): <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">/\D/.match(isbn_string.chop)</span>.</li>
    <br>
    <li>And then! On Day 7 of THM's Advent of Cyber, we practiced examining a malicious attachment. Once we extracted the ASCII and Unicode-printable sequences, we looked for embedded strings that could lead to suspicious domains. But of course the attacker tried to obfuscate their code, so we used a regex to find and remove some repeated characters. I guess once you start looking, regex (regexes?) are everywhere. </li>

      <li>Made a simple terminal app! It uses a number of tty gems for &#10024;beautification&#10024; and a few
        different free APIs
        to generate the data.

      <br>
      <li> I tackled my scraping project again, but I haven't figured out how to get the data I really want. I'm trying
        to collect the trails for the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area, where I patrol as a US Forest Service volunteer. A
        state website has the KMZ for all trails in CO, so I was able to convert that to a ZIP file and extract the KML
        file that I could then open in Google Earth. BUT I haven't yet figured out how to extract only the information I
        want.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I tried using <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">nokogiri</span>
        because my KML file is actually primarily composed of XML and HTML. I tested my code to print the doc to the
        terminal and for some reason it only pulled a small portion. It did, interestingly, include more DOM-like
        features
        than were visible in the KML file I was working with in in TextEdit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>

      <li>Starting TryHackMe's <a

          target="_blank">Advent of Cyber</a>! We'll complete a task each day of the month and cover red teaming,
        cyber
        investigations, web exploitation, IoT hacking, and cyber defense &#127873; &#127876;. On Day 2, I learned how to
        use <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">nano</span> to get
        a sense for the data in a log file, <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">wc -l</span> to
        get the number of lines in it, and <span style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">grep</span> to
        search!</li>
      <br>
      <li>Day 3 was all about OSINT techniques like google dorking, which is using advanced search terms to locate
        specific file
        types, versions, text, and more; checking the WHOIS
        information of a website; evaluating the robots.txt file; and searching GitHub repos.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I was trying to write code that could tell if a string was all uppercase AND devoid of letters,
        and
        I
        was surprised to see that a fully numeric string was interpreted as uppercase. I eventually settled with <span
          style="background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #999">elsif sentence == sentence.upcase &&
          sentence.include?("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")</span> but there's gotta be a better way.</li>
      <br>
      <li>I think I may have found that better way. But first, an apparently famous joke:
        <em>"Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have
          two problems."</em>
      </li>

      <li>Tried to build a simple <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-ruby/" target="_blank">web
          scraper</a> in Ruby. Scraping is tricky: it requires the relevant gem
        installs, familiarity with the DOM, logic to search through selectors, and some way to export it - before even
        tackling a dynamic page. I was able to scrape bits off a Wikipedia page and export those to a CSV file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="learnings">learnings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I internalized the value of testing code in the rails console. It was how I figured out what exactly we were
        trying to do in the whole MVC structure, and testing it earlier was a lot less cumbersome than finding errors
        later. We'd swiftly find out if our model associations weren't quite right, without having to suffer through
        making the controller attempt to generate a view.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Tackled a team project this week! Finding the right team rhythm is just as important as figuring out the code.
        We improved our ability to successfully implement Git branches and pulls and we found good resources that helped
        us with
        parts of the problem that were beyond our current skillset. In the future we'd spend more time conceptutalizing
        the project as a whole before diving in.</li>

        Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Input sanitization, particularly the removal of necessary coding
        characters and dangerous keywords, is important to defending against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li>

        <p>Computers may be as close as we get to magic in the real world: we type incantations into a machine, and â€”

          the incantations are right â€” the machine does our bidding. To perform such magic, computer witches and
          wizards
          rely not only on words, but also on wands, potions, and an ancient tome or two. Taken together, these tricks
          of the trade are known as software development: computer programming, plus tools like command lines, text
          editors, and version control.</p>
